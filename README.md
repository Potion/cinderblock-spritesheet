cinderblock-spritesheet
=======================
This is a simple cinderblock to allow Cinder (http://libcinder.org) users to easily create and deploy 
sprite sheets created with texturepacker. ( http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker )

It's pretty simple to use, and integrates with Cinder's timeline animation class.

N.B. - Currently it only supports generic XML spritesheets which use the "Basic" Layout Algorithm,
so be sure to export your textures with that option selected. 

See the example projects for a working implementation. 

Feel free to send requests/comments to me alias@proalias.com or on the Cinder forum ( http:://forum.libcinder.org ).

Enjoy! Viva la c√≥digo abierto!
